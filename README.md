**Customer Churn Prediction using ANN | Keras and TensorFlow**

**Introduction**
This notebook demonstrates how to build and train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict customer churn. The dataset used for this project is the Credit Card Customer Churn Prediction dataset available on Kaggle. The notebook walks through data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation using Keras and TensorFlow.

**Features**
Data preprocessing and normalization
Building an ANN with Keras
Training and evaluating the model
Visualizing training history and model performance

Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow
Keras
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
